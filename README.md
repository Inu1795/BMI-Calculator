# BMI-Calculator
Hello There, This is a basic application based on Flutter framework which i used as my first project in learning dart and hybrid application development. 
Basically, It is a Body Mass Index calculator. It takes inputs as body height and weight, based on the data it gives the exact Body Mass Index and then even tells the app user about his category from a)Severely Underweight, b)Underweight, c)Normal, d)Overweight, e)Obese.
This is just a basic project. You can find the code here. 
v.2.0 - will consist the BMI based on gender and age group.
